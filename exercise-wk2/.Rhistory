## Part 2 - Vector and function practice
# Make a vector and use typeof to check what type R considers it to be
# Write a function `CompareLength` that takes in 2 vectors, and returns the sentence:
# "The difference in lengths is N"
# Pass two vectors of different length to your `CompareLength` function
# Write a function `DescribeDifference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first vector is longer by N elements"
# "Your second vector is longer by N elements"
# Pass two vectors to your `DescribeDifference` function
# Write a function `CombineVectors` that takes in 3 vectors and combines them into one
# Send 3 vectors to your function to test it.
# Write a function `CapsTime` that takes in a vector of names of courses you're taking, ex "Informatics 201" and removes all capital letters
